### Abstract
Recent progresses in large-scale text-to-image models have yielded remarkable accomplishments, finding various applications in art domain.
However, expressing unique characteristics of an artwork (*e.g.* brushwork, colortone, or composition) with text prompts alone may encounter limitations due to the inherent constraints of verbal description.
To this end, we introduce **DreamStyler**, a novel framework designed for artistic image synthesis, proficient in both text-to-image synthesis and style transfer.
DreamStyler optimizes a multi-stage textual embedding with a context-aware text prompt, resulting in prominent image quality.
In addition, with content and style guidance, DreamStyler exhibits flexibility to accommodate a range of style references.
Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance across multiple scenarios, suggesting its promising potential in artistic product creation.

## Codes
The training code and datasets will soon be hosted at [webtoon/dreamstyler](https://github.com/webtoon/dreamstyler). Please stay tuned!
